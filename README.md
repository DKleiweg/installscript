# My personal dotfiles

My personal installscript.

You can install them by cloning the repository as `installscript` in your home directory and running the bootstrap script.

```
git clone git@github.com:DKleiweg/installscript.git
cd installscript
./bootstrap
```

The bootstrap script can be run by cd-ing into the `.installscript` directory and performing this command:

```bash
./bootstrap
```
